    This is the type of object used as keys in a PSChainClass table. It is a
    tuple of ClassTuple objects. (Perhaps we can use the new python NamedTuple
    at some point to identify the members of the Key. We CANNOT use a
    simplemeta object, because the key has to be immutable).

    The [0] element is the backtrack, the [1] element is the input sequence,
    and the [2] element is the lookahead. Note that the order of classes in the
    [0] element is the same as the order in the [1] and [2] elements: that is,
    the "natural" order. The reversal in the binary data is handled internally,
    and the client doesn't have to worry about it.

    There are no fromwalker or buildBinary methods; that is handled at the
    higher level of the PSChainClass object itself.
