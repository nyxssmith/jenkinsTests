class Key(tuple, metaclass=seqmeta.FontDataMetaclass):
    """
    This is the type of object used as keys in a PSChainCoverage table. It is a
    tuple of CoverageTuple objects. (Perhaps we can use the new python
    NamedTuple at some point to identify the members of the Key. We CANNOT use
    a simplemeta object, because the key has to be immutable).

    The [0] element is the backtrack, the [1] element is the input sequence,
    and the [2] element is the lookahead. Note that the order of CoverageSets
    in the [0] element is the same as the order in the [1] and [2] elements:
    that is, the "natural" order. The reversal in the binary data is handled
    internally, and the client doesn't have to worry about it.

    There are no fromwalker or buildBinary methods; that is handled at the
    higher level of the PSChainCoverage object itself.
